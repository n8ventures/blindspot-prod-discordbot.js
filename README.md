## 2.1.0 Patch Notes
***NEW*** Calculate all Apex matches under that one Apex token.

**this is currently experimental due to user input error.*

if there are more than one matches in the single token, you will then be prompted to choose if you'd like to calculate all those matches.
you can index it via:
- Team name.
- Team number.

to use this feature, you need to have multiple matches in that one token. Use `/apexprivateresults` command. After the response, you'll be prompted by a set of buttons, select the green `gimme dat data!` button to activate it.

Improved optimization
- Cleaned and tidied up code (less duplicates, more smart coding)
